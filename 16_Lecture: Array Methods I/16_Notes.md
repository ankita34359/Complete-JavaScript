# Understanding Array Methods in JavaScript

In this lecture, we will explore some essential array methods in JavaScript that help in manipulating arrays effectively.

## 1.) toString() - Convert an Array to a String

The `toString()` method converts an array into a comma-separated string.

### Key Points:

- It does not modify the original array.
- Only converts elements to a string representation.
- No custom separators (use join() for that).

## 2.) join() - Convert an Array to a String with a Custom Separator

The join() method is similar to toString(), but allows you to specify a separator.

### Key Points:

- You can define any separator (,, -, |, etc.).
- It does not modify the original array.
