# String Methods in JavaScript

Strings in JavaScript come with built-in methods that allow us to manipulate, search, and analyze text efficiently. This lecture covers commonly used string methods with clear explanations and examples.

## 1. length

The length property returns the number of characters in a string.

## 2. toUpperCase() and toLowerCase()

These methods convert a string to uppercase or lowercase.

## 3. trim()

Removes whitespace from both ends of a string.

## 4. slice(start, end)

Extracts a part of a string and returns it as a new string. The `start` index is inclusive, and the `end` index is exclusive.
