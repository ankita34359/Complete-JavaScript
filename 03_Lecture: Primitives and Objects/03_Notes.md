# Primitives and Objects in JavaScript

## 1. Primitives

Primitives are the most basic building blocks of JavaScript. They represent single, immutable values.

### Types of Primitives

JavaScript has the following primitive data types:

**Number:** Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

Special numeric values:

- Infinity (e.g., 1 / 0)

- -Infinity

- NaN (Not a Number, e.g., 0 / 0).

**String:** Represents text enclosed in single ('), double ("), or backticks (` for template literals).

**Boolean:** Represents logical values: true or false.

**Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a placeholder for "nothing."

**Undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
