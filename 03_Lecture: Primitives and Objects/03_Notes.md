# Primitives and Objects in JavaScript

## 1. Primitives

Primitives are the most basic building blocks of JavaScript. They represent single, immutable values.

### Types of Primitives

JavaScript has the following primitive data types:

- **Number:** Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

-- Special numeric values:

    - Infinity (e.g., 1 / 0)

    - -Infinity

    - NaN (Not a Number, e.g., 0 / 0).

- **String:** Represents text enclosed in single ('), double ("), or backticks (` for template literals).

**Boolean:** Represents logical values: true or false.

**Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a placeholder for "nothing."

**Undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.

**Symbol:** Represents unique values introduced in ES6.

**BigInt:** Represents very large integers introduced in ES11 (2020).

### Characteristics of Primitives:

**Immutable:** The value cannot be changed after itâ€™s created.

**Stored by Value:** When you copy a primitive value, a new copy is created.
