# 1. Primitives

Primitives are the most basic building blocks of JavaScript. They represent single, immutable values.

## Types of Primitives

JavaScript has the following primitive data types:

**Number:** Represents numeric values, including integers and floating-point numbers.

Example: 10, 3.14, -42.

Special numeric values:
Infinity (e.g., 1 / 0)
-Infinity
NaN (Not a Number, e.g., 0 / 0).
String: Represents text enclosed in single ('), double ("), or backticks (` for template literals).

Example: 'Hello', "World", `Welcome, ${name}!`.
Boolean: Represents logical values: true or false.

Example: let isLoggedIn = true;.
Null: Represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is a placeholder for "nothing."

Example: let noValue = null;.
Undefined: Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
