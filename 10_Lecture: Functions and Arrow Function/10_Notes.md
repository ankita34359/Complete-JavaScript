# Functions and Arrow Functions in JavaScript

Functions are fundamental building blocks in JavaScript. They allow us to organize code into reusable, logical units. This lecture covers two types of functions in detail: regular functions (with and without parameters) and arrow functions (with and without parameters).

## 1. What is a Function?


A function is a block of code designed to perform a specific task. Functions help organize and reuse code, making programs more efficient and easier to maintain.

### Syntax of a Function:

```javascript
function functionName(parameters) {
  // Code to execute
  return value; // Optional
}
```

## 2. Functions Without Parameters

Functions without parameters donâ€™t take any inputs. They perform tasks independently of any external data.
