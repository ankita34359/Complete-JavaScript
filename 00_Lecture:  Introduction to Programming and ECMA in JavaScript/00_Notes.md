# What is Programming? 

Programming is the process of giving instructions to a computer to perform specific tasks. These instructions are written in a language that the computer can understand, known as a programming language.

## Key Points about Programming:

### Why do we need programming?

- To solve problems efficiently using computers.
- To automate repetitive tasks.
- To create applications, websites, games, and more.

### How does programming work?

- A programmer writes code in a specific programming language (like JavaScript).
- The code is converted into machine language (binary) that the computer can execute.

## What is ECMA in JavaScript?

ECMA (European Computer Manufacturers Association) is an organization that sets standards for technologies, including programming languages.

JavaScript follows a standard called ECMAScript (ES). This standard ensures that JavaScript works consistently across different platforms and browsers.

### Key Versions of ECMAScript:

ES5 (2009): Introduced features like strict mode and array methods.

ES6 (2015): A major update with features like let, const, arrow functions, and classes.

Later versions: ES7, ES8, and so on, added more advanced features like async/await, promises, and optional chaining.

## Why is ECMA Important?
- It defines the rules and syntax for JavaScript.
- Helps JavaScript evolve while maintaining compatibility with older versions.
- Ensures developers have a common understanding of how JavaScript works.
