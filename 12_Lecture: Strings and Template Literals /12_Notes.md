# Strings, Template Literals, String Interpolation, and Escape Sequence Characters in JavaScript

Strings are one of the most fundamental data types in JavaScript. In this lecture, weâ€™ll dive deep into strings, template literals, string interpolation, and escape sequence characters with simple explanations and examples.

## Strings in JavaScript

A string is a sequence of characters used to represent text. In JavaScript, strings can be defined using:

- Double quotes (" ")
- Single quotes (' ')
- Backticks (` `) - Template literals.

### Key Points:

- Double and single quotes are interchangeable but must be consistent.
- Template literals (backticks) provide additional features like string interpolation.

## Template Literals

Template literals are a type of string enclosed in backticks (` `). They are more powerful than regular strings because they allow:

### Multiline Strings.

String Interpolation (inserting variables or expressions directly).
Multiline Strings:
Template literals make it easy to write strings that span multiple lines.
