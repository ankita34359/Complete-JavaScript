# Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed Languages

This document provides an overview of **statically typed** and **dynamically typed** programming languages, their differences, and examples to illustrate their concepts. This is part of my JavaScript learning journey.

## What Are They?

Programming languages can be classified based on how they handle type-checking:

### **Statically Typed Languages**
- In statically typed languages, the data type of a variable is determined at compile time.
- Variables must be declared with a type (explicitly or inferred).
- Type errors are caught during compilation.

**Examples:** C, C++, Java, TypeScript, Rust.
