# Statically Typed vs Dynamically Typed Languages

This document provides an overview of **statically typed** and **dynamically typed** programming languages, their differences, and examples to illustrate their concepts. This is part of my JavaScript learning journey.

## What Are They?

Programming languages can be classified based on how they handle type-checking:

### **Statically Typed Languages**
- In statically typed languages, the data type of a variable is determined at compile time.
- Variables must be declared with a type (explicitly or inferred).
- Type errors are caught during compilation.

**Examples:** C, C++, Java, TypeScript, Rust.

### **Dynamically Typed Languages**
- In dynamically typed languages, the data type of a variable is determined at runtime.
- Variables do not require a type declaration; their types can change dynamically.
- Type errors are caught only during program execution.

**Examples:** JavaScript, Python, Ruby, PHP.

## Key Differences

| **Aspect**             | **Statically Typed**                  | **Dynamically Typed**           |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------|---------------------------------|
| **Type Checking**      | Compile-time                         | Runtime                         |
| **Type Declaration**   | Required (explicit or inferred)      | Not required                    |
| **Error Detection**    | Before execution (compile-time)      | During execution (runtime)      |
| **Flexibility**        | More rigid; fewer runtime surprises  | More flexible but prone to errors|
| **Performance**        | Often faster due to type safety      | May have overhead for type checks|

## When to Use Which?
- **Statically Typed Languages:**
  - Ideal for large-scale applications where type safety and maintainability are critical.
  - Reduces runtime errors and makes debugging easier.

- **Dynamically Typed Languages:**
  - Great for rapid prototyping and smaller projects.
  - Allows for flexibility and faster development cycles.

## Conclusion
Understanding the differences between statically and dynamically typed languages helps us to choose the right tool for our project. While JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, learning about both paradigms enhances our programming skills and broadens our perspective.
