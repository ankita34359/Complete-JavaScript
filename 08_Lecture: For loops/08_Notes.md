# For Loops in JavaScript

In JavaScript, loops are used to repeat a block of code as long as a specified condition is true. The for loop is one of the most commonly used looping structures, providing a concise and efficient way to iterate through arrays, objects, or other iterable elements.

## The for Loop

### What is a for Loop?

The for loop repeats a block of code a set number of times. Itâ€™s especially useful when you know how many times you need to iterate.

### Syntax:

```javascript

for (initialization; condition; increment) {
  // Code to execute on each iteration
}

```
