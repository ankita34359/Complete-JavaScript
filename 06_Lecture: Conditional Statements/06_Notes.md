# Conditional Statements in JavaScript

Conditional statements are used in JavaScript to make decisions in our code. They allow us to execute certain blocks of code based on specific conditions.

## 1. What Are Conditional Statements?

Conditional statements are programming constructs that execute a block of code only if a specified condition evaluates to true. These are essential for implementing logic in programs.

## 2. Types of Conditional Statements in JavaScript

### a. if Statement

The if statement checks a condition and executes the code block if the condition is true.

Syntax:

```javascript

if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if condition is true
}

```
### b. if...else Statement

The if...else statement provides an alternative block of code to execute when the condition is false.

Syntax:

```javascript
if (condition) {
  // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
  // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```
