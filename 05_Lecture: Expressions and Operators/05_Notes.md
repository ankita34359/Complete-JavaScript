# Expressions and Operators in JavaScript

In JavaScript, expressions and operators are fundamental building blocks that let us to perform actions, calculations, and logic in our code.

## 1. Expressions

### What is an Expression?

An expression is any valid unit of code that resolves to a value.

### Types of Expressions:

**Arithmetic Expressions:** Perform mathematical operations.

**String Expressions:** Combine or manipulate strings.

**Logical Expressions:** Evaluate to true or false.

**Function Expressions:** Define a function as part of an expression.

**Conditional Expressions:** Return different values based on a condition (ternary operator).

## 2. Operators

### What is an Operator?

An operator is a symbol or keyword that performs an operation on operands.

### Types of Operators:

1. Arithmetic Operators

Used for mathematical calculations.

| **Operator** | **Description**          | **Example** | **Result** |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------|------------|
| `+`          | Addition                 | `5 + 3`     | `8`        |
| `-`          | Subtraction              | `5 - 3`     | `2`        |
| `*`          | Multiplication           | `5 * 3`     | `15`       |
| `/`          | Division                 | `6 / 3`     | `2`        |
| `%`          | Modulus (remainder)      | `5 % 2`     | `1`        |
| `**`         | Exponentiation           | `2 ** 3`    | `8`        |
